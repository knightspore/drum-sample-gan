# A GAN for Generating Music Samples

> Goal: Create a small batch of one-shot samples generated by a traineed adversarial network.

### Input Data

We can use the sample finder util to generate a (size-limited) dataset for input. 

Input Sample `{ path: ..., class: ..., }` => Mel Spectrogram => Tensor

### Output Data

Tensor => Mel Spectrogram => .wav File

### Discriminator

Techniques from (this Classifier)[https://github.com/knightspore/drum-sample-classifier] could be benchmarked against a discriminator described in CWG below. This could be used, with outputs reduced to 1 instead of 10.

I should also look into (autoencoders)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwrzh4e8DLs&t=467s].

### Generator

One option is to use (Conditional WaveGAN)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10636.pdf]. The discriminator is not all that different to the classifier I wrote, and I may even use it as a starting point.
